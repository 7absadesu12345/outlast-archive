## 📖 Overview  
**Outlast Archive** is a first-person horror game where players explore a creepy archival facility, uncover dark secrets, and survive the unknown.  

We built the game using a **starter FPS template** for fps and lightning and some other 3d stuff if that is ok with the hackathon rules.
