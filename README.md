## Overview  
**Outlast Archive** is a first-person horror like game where players explore their files.

We built the game using a **starter FPS template** for fps and lightning and some other 3d stuff if that is ok with the hackathon rules.

## Features  
**Immersive First-Person Gameplay** – Explore and interact with the environment.  
**Dynamic Lighting** – Atmospheric lighting enhances the horror experience.  
**Interactive Objects** – Players can pick up and examine items like files and typewriters.  
**Puzzle Elements** – Solve tasks to progress deeper into the archive.  
**Horror Ambience** – Designed to keep players on edge.  
**Backend Integration** – Connected with [Folder Heaven](https://github.com/BLLALL/folder-heaven) for storing and managing in-game files/data.
